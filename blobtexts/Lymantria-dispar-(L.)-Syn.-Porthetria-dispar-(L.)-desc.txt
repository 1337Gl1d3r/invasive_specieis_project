<strong>General Description: </strong>

Gypsy moths are part of a group called tus
-
sock moths because their larvae bear dense 
brushes of hairs.

 Their native distribution is 
Europe, North Africa, Asia, and Japan. The 
European race was accidentally introduced 
to the eastern U.S. in 1868 and spread to Que
-
bec and Ontario as well as western states 
and then northward along the coast.

 Individ
-
uals of the Asian was race were discovered 
in Vancouver in 1991 on shipping containers, 
as well as Washington and Oregon.
Gypsy moths have over 300 known hosts 
plants including both native and introduced 
trees/shrubs such as fruits, nuts, and orna
-
mentals. The Asian race has broader host 
range - also feeds on larch and some cedars 
and firs - and spreads faster.

In the European race of gypsy moths, only 
males can fly - both sexes of Asian race are 
strong fliers. Light can attract the moths over 
great distances making airports, sea ports, 
and urban parking lots favoured sites for egg 
laying.

 While European race females will lay 
eggs near their pupation sites, Asian race 
females will lay eggs on objects associated 
with lights.

 While some countries do inspect 
ships and cargo containers for pests, the 
time between inspection and the ship leav
-
ing port can be long enough for gypsy moths 
to lay eggs.
