<strong>General Description: </strong>

Whirling disease is a disease of salmonoid fishes and has 
recently been found in Alberta. This disease can cause high 
levels of mortality in some fish, but it is not known how it will 
impact Alberta fish populations. 
There are no health concerns for people swimming in or 
drinking water that contains whirling disease. Eating an infected 
fish is not known to cause any harmful effects to animals or 
people.
Whirling disease affects salmonoid fishes, including trout, 
salmon and whitefish. Whirling disease requires two hosts - a 
Tubifex worm and a fish. The disease is caused by a parasite 
which can affect nerves and cause cartilage damage. This 
may cause the fish to abnormally whirl around in a tail-chasing 
behaviour and/or to display a characteristic blackened tail. 
There is no treatment currently available for whirling disease; 
therefore, containment and prevention are the best responses. 
While the disease can spread naturally, it can also be spread 
by human activity. Albertans should be aware that it is illegal 
to transport fish between water bodies and that all aquatic 
equipment must be thoroughly cleaned after leaving a 
waterbody.
