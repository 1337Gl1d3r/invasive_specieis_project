<strong>General Description: </strong>

Clubroot is caused by the soil-borne disease 
Plasmodiophora brassicae. Infection by 
this pathogen causes large galls to form on 
roots, which interferes with water and nu
-
trient uptake.

This pathogen affects plants 
in the Brassicaceae family which includes 
vegetable crops like cabbages, cauliflowers, 
radish, and canola, and can reduce yields 
significantly.
In the late 1800s a large portion of the cab
-
bage crop failed in Russia due to infection by 
P. brassicae. The Russian scientist Woronin 
identified the pathogen and named it.
 In the 
U.S., first reports of clubroot occurred in the 
1850s
 and up until 2003 it was only sporadi
-
cally reported on the Canadian praries.
 At 
this time it was first identified on canola in 
Alberta.

Since infection by P. brassicae reduces 
the host plant's ability to obtain resources, 
symptoms of infection are stunting, yellow
-
ing and wilting.
 Examination of the plant's 
roots for galls is the only way to confirm in
-
fection. Some other factors can cause root 
swelling, so if clubroot is suspected it should 
be confirmed by qualified individuals.
