<strong>General Description: </strong>

Feral pigs are native to Europe and continental Asia,  as far south and east as Malaysia.

They have one of the widest distributions 
of all terrestrial mammals - feral pigs are 
present on all continents and many oceanic 
islands (due to introductions by early seafarers) except Antarctica.

 They are the ancestor of most modern domestic pig breeds. 
Over-hunting and land use changes extirpated the animal from the British Isles (17th cen
-
tury), Scandinavia, and parts of North Africa, 
Russia, and northern Japan.

 They have been 
reintroduced in the UK and re-established in 
the wild (2005.)

The IUCN's Invasive Species Specialist 
Group have nominated the feral pig as one of 
the 100 "World's Worst Invaders." Despite 
this, some subspecies around the world 
are considered at risk from habitat impacts, 
over-hunting, and genetic contamination 
from interbreeding with domestic pigs.

In Alberta feral pigs are raised for gourmet 
meat markets, and escapees have established feral populations. Alberta Agriculture 
& Forestry  reports there are populations in 
north-central and northwestern Alberta but 
numbers of animals are uncertain. The Agricultural Service Boards and Alberta Agriculture have been working cooperatively to 
control wild boars at large. For information
