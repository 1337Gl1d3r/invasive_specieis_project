<strong>General Description: </strong>

Large, club-shaped galls form on the roots of 
host plants, which initially are "firm and have 
a whitish-coloured appearance, but become 
soft, spongy and take on a brownish colour 
as they mature and decompose later in the 
season."
 The extent of galling varies and 
depends on; amount of P. brassicae inoculum 
in the soil, environmental conditions at the 
time, and the presence of any resistance in 
the host plant.
